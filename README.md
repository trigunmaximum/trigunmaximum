<h3>I LOVE TRIGUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h3>
<blockquote>my favorite is trigun maximum, but i love all three! my triguniversary is april 20th, 2023. my favorite characters are the main quartet, LR, & legato, but i love pretty much every character except chapel LOL. dni btw if you're KV i think incest is weird and bad.</blockquote>
i also love <i>fire emblem</i>, <i>monster hunter</i>, & <i>tamagotchi!</i> please feel free to talk to me about any of these, i am very passionate about them... ♡ outside of media, i like writing, drawing, gardening, making rainbow loom bracelets, and all things citrus, but particularly oranges!
